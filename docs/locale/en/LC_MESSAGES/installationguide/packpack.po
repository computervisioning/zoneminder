"If you are looking for an easy way to run ZoneMinder and not interested "

#: ../../installationguide/packpack.rst:8
msgid ""
"These instructions represent an alternative way to build ZoneMinder for "
"any supported distro."

#: ../../installationguide/packpack.rst:10
msgid "Advantages:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../installationguide/packpack.rst:12
msgid "Fewer steps and therefore much simpler"
msgstr ""

#: ../../installationguide/packpack.rst:13
msgid ""
"Target distro agnostic - the steps are the same regardless of the target "

#: ../../installationguide/packpack.rst:14

"Host distro agnostic - the steps described here should work on any host "

msgid "Background"

#: ../../installationguide/packpack.rst:19
msgid ""
"These instructions leverage the power of the automated build system "
"recently implemented in the ZoneMinder project. Behind the scenes, a "
"project called `packpack <https://github.com/packpack/packpack>`_ is "

"Open the project's `.travis.yml file "

"build matrix. The distros shown in the matrix are those known to build on"
" ZoneMinder. If the distro you desire is in the list then continue to "

"If the desired distro is not in the first list, then open the `packpack "

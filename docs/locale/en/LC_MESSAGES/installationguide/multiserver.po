"For systemd based linux distros, inspect the zoneminder service file, "

"multiserver to function correctly. For example, the service file may "
"check for a running instance of mysql or mariadb running locally on the "
"server. This check will need to be removed. Rather than edit the service "
"file directly, copy the service file to /etc/systemd/system and edit the "

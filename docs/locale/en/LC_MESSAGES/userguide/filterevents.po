"Date::Manip package. Not all date formats are available in both so if you"
" are saved your filter to do automatic deletions or other tasks you "

"The other things you can filter on are all fairly self explanatory, "
"except perhaps for 'Archived' which you can use to include or exclude "
"Archived events. In general you'll probably do most filtering on un-"
"archived events. There are also two elements, Disk Blocks and Disk "
"Percent which don’t directly relate to the events themselves but to the "
"disk partition on which the events are stored. These allow you to specify"
" an amount of disk usage either in blocks or in percentage as returned by"
" the ‘df’ command. They relate to the amount of disk space used and not "
"the amount left free. Once your filter is specified, clicking 'submit' "
"will filter the events according to your specification. As the disk based"
" elements are not event related directly if you create a filter and "
"include the term ‘DiskPercent > 95’ then if your current disk usage is "
"over that amount when you submit the filter then all events will be "
"listed whereas if it is less then none at all will. As such the disk "
"related terms will tend to be used mostly for automatic filters (see "
"below). If you have created a filter you want to keep, you can name it "

"Filtering is a powerful mechanism you can use to eliminate events that "
"fit a certain pattern however in many cases modifying the zone settings "
"will better address this. Where it really comes into its own is generally"
" in applying time filters, so for instance events that happen during "
"weekdays or at certain times of the day are highlighted, uploaded or "
"deleted. Additionally using disk related terms in your filters means you "
"can automatically create filters that delete the oldest events when your "
"disk gets full. Be warned however that if you use this strategy then you "
"should limit the returned results to the amount of events you want "
"deleted in each pass until the disk usage is at an acceptable level. If "
"you do not do this then the first pass when the disk usage is high will "
"match, and then delete, all events unless you have used other criteria "
"inside of limits. ZoneMinder ships with a sample filter already "
"installed, though disabled. The PurgeWhenFull filter can be used to "
"delete the oldest events when your disk starts filling up. To use it you "
"should select and load it in the filter interface, modify it to your "
"requirements, and then save it making you sure you check the ‘Delete all "
"matches’ option. This will then run in the background and ensure that "
"your disk does not fill up with events."

"If you are using relative times like 'now' or '1 year ago' etc. remember "
"that zmfilter converts that relative time to an absolute date only when "
"it reloads filters, which is dictated by the FILTER_RELOAD_DELAY "
"duration. So, for example, if you are wondering why your events are not "
"being detected before intervals of 5 minutes and you have used such a "
"relative condition, this is why"

"In the event that you see your new filter is working great when you try "
"it out from the Web Console (using the Submit or Execute button) but does"
" not seem to work when its running in background mode, you might have "
"just chanced upon a compatibility issue between how Perl and PHP "
"translate free form text to dates/times. When you test it via the "
"\"Submit\" or \"Execute\" button, you are invoking a PHP function for "
"time conversion. When the filter runs in background mode, zmfilter.pl "
"calls a perl equivalent function. In some cases, depending on the version"
" of Perl and PHP you have, the results may vary. If you face this "
"situation, the best thing to do is to run ``sudo zmfilter.pl -f "
"<yourfiltername>`` from a terminal to make sure the filter actually works"
" in Perl as well."

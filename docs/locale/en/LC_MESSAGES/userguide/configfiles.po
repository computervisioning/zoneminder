"At one point of time, ZoneMinder stored various system path "
"configurations under the Web UI (``Options->Paths``). This was removed a "
"few versions ago and now resides in a configuration file. The motivation "

"``03-custom.conf`` is an  custom config file that I created to override "
"specific variables in the path files. **This is the recommended way to "
"customize entries**. Anything that you want to change should be in a new "
"file inside ``conf.d``. Note that ZoneMinder will sort all the files "
"alphabetically and run their contents in ascending order. So it doesn't "
"really matter what you name them, as long as you make sure your changes "
"are not overwritten by another file in the sorting sequence. It is "
"therefore good practice to prefix your file names by ``nn-`` where ``nn``"
" is a monotonically increasing numerical sequence ``01-`` ``02-`` ``03-``"
" and so forth, so you know the order they will be processed."

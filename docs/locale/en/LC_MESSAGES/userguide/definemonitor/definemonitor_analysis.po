"**Analysis FPS**: Motion detection is not required on every frame "
"captured. For a stream captured at 30 FPS, motion detection can be "
"adequate at 5 FPS for most cases. Motion detection is very CPU intensive "
"so reducing the Analysis FPS as low as possible allows more cameras to be"
" added to the system."

"**Reference Image Blend %ge**: Each analysed image in ZoneMinder is a "
"composite of previous images and is formed by applying the current image "
"as a certain percentage of the previous reference image. Thus, if we "
"entered the value of 10% here, each imageâ€™s part in the reference image "
"will diminish by a factor of 0.9 each time round. So a typical reference "
"image will be 10% of the previous image, 9% the one before that and then "
"8.1%, 7.2%, 6.5% and so on of the rest of the way. An image will "
"effectively vanish around 25 images later than when it was added. This "
"blend value is what is specified here and if higher will make slower "
"progressing events less detectable as the reference image would change "
"more quickly. Similarly, events will be deemed to be over much sooner as "
"the reference image adapts to the new images more quickly. In signal "
"processing terms the higher this value the steeper the event attack and "
"decay of the signal. Default value is 6.25% for Indoor cameras and 12.5% "
"for Outdoor cameras."

"**Linked Monitors**: This field allows you to select other monitors or "
"zones on your system that act as triggers for this monitor. So if you "
"have a camera covering one aspect of your property you can force all "
"cameras to record when that camera detects motion or other events. You "
"can either directly enter a comma separated list of monitor IDs or click "
"on :guilabel:`Add Monitor Link` pulldown menu. Be careful not to create "
"circular dependencies with this feature as it may cause infinitely "
"persisting alarms. To unlink monitors you can ctrl-click. You can also "
"enter logical operators here to create more complex logic ( | = OR, & = "
"AND).  So A | B means record if either A or B is alarmed. A & B means "
"trigger if both A and B are alarmed."

"**Timestamp Label Format**: Allows one to define the format of the "
"timestamp applied to each frame. It is a ``strftime`` style string with a"
" few extra tokens. You can add ``%f`` to add hundredths of a second to "
"the frame timestamp. ``%H:%M:%S.%f`` will output time formatted as "
"``10:45:37.45``. You can also use ``%N`` for the name of the monitor and "
"``%Q`` which will be filled by any of the ‘show text’ detailed in the "
"``zmtriggers.pl`` section."

"**Timestamp Label X/Y**: The X and Y values determine location of "
"timestamp in the image. A value of 0 for the X value will put it on the "
"left side of the image and a Y value of 0 will place it at the top of the"
" image. Be careful not to place the timestamp outside the image border."

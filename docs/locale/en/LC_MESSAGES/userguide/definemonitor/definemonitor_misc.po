"**Event Prefix**: By default events are named ‘Event-<event id>’, where "
"'Event-' is the prefix. This option lets you modify the event prefix to "
"be a value of your choice so that events are named differently when they "
"are generated. This allows you to name events according to which monitor "
"generated them."

"**Section Length**: This specifies the length (in seconds) of any fixed "
"length events produced when the Monitor Recording is set to 'Always' or "
"'On Motion / Trigger / etc'. Otherwise it is ignored. This should not be "
"so long that events are difficult to navigate nor so short that too many "
"events are generated. A length of between 300 and 900 seconds is "
"recommended but should be set appropriately for each server."

"**Minimum Section Length**: This specifies the minimum length (in "
"seconds) of events which will be recorded."

"**Frame Skip**: This setting also applies only to the 'Always' Monitor "
"record functions and specifies how many frames should be skipped in the "
"recorded events. The default setting of zero results in every captured "
"frame being saved. Using a value of one would mean that one frame is "
"skipped between each saved, two means that two frames are skipped between"
" each saved frame etc. An alternate way of thinking is that one in every "
"‘Frame Skip + 1’ frames is saved. The point of this is to ensure that "
"saved events do not take up too much space unnecessarily whilst still "
"allowing the camera to capture at a fairly high frame rate. The alternate"
" approach is to limit the capture frame rate which will obviously affect "
"the rate at which frames are saved."

"**Motion Frame Skip**: This has similar behavior as Frame Skip but is "

"**FPS Report Interval**: How often the current performance in terms of "
"Frames Per Second is output to the system log and updated in the Monitor "
"Status table. A lower value can cause excess logging and has a slight "
"database performance penalty. The default value of 100 is likely fine for"
" most systems during setup. At 10fps this will cause an update every 10 "
"seconds. Once the system is configured and stable a higher number can be "
"used to reduce logfile clutter."

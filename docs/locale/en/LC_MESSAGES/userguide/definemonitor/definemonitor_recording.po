"The Recording tab contains settings for recording the video and audio "
"streams. The video stream can be saved as JPEG, re-encoded to different "
"standards or allowed to passthrough and save in the original form as "

"Camera Passthrough: This option assumes that the camera is already "

"processing in ZoneMinder. Video characteristics such as bitrate, encoding"
" mode, etc. should be set directly in the camera. The resulting video "

"There are several methods for adding Monitors in ZoneMinder. Most "
"commonly one will use Manual entry in which each tab is completed with "
"the appropriate information. There are several ways to identify and add "
"Monitors through network scanning, ONVIF probing and available presets "
"that can enter partial Monitor information. However, even with these "
"aids, one will still need to review the appropriate Monitor tabs and "
"enter or confirm the required information."

"**Manual Entry**: Use the :guilabel:`+ADD` link on Console and enter the "
"Monitor information manually into each tab. Enter Monitor configuration "
"by selecting each tab described in the sections below and entering the "
"configuration."

"**Scan Network**: Use the :guilabel:`SCAN NETWORK` link on Console and "

"**ONVIF Probe**: Use the :guilabel:`+ADD` link then the **ONVIF** icon "

"ZoneMinder Monitor setup includes not only the basic stream settings such"
" as the source path and resolution but also settings related to analysis,"
" recording, PTZ control, time stamping, RTSP re-streaming, and much more."
" As such, the Monitor options are divided into a set of tabs related to "
"each category to facilitate configuration. One note regarding Monitor "
"tabs is that it is not necessary to :guilabel:`SAVE` each tab separately."
" Before leaving the Monitor setup one can click :guilabel:`SAVE` on any "
"tab to update the Monitor settings. It is recommended that Monitor entry "
"starts with the General tab and then steps to each successive tab below. "
"Monitor tabs are explained in more detail in the sections below."

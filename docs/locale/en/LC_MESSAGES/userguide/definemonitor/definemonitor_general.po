"The General tab contains basic information about the Monitor to help "
"distinguish it to ZoneMinder and the user. One very important parameter "
"to note is the **Source Type** which must match the specific Monitor one "
"wants to add. The selection of source type determines the information "
"required for entry in the Source tab."

"**Groups**: Monitors can be combined into groups. This allows a smaller "

"**Triggers**: ZoneMinder can trigger actions based on X10 protocol. X10 "
"support must first be enabled with :guilabel:`OPT_X10` in the Options "
"menu. An alternative to Triggers is to use ``cron`` jobs or other "
"mechanisms to control the camera and keep them completely outside of the "
"ZoneMinder settings. The ``zmtrigger.pl`` script is also available to "
"implement custom external triggering."

"The ZoneMinder web interface does not use APIs and therefore, the tokens "
"discussed here don't apply to the ZoneMinder UI. These only apply to apps"
" that use the ZoneMinder API, like zmNinja."

"The API option screen allows you enable/disable APIs on a per user basis."
" Furthermore, it also allows you to \"revoke\" tokens allotted to users. "
"Starting ZoneMinder 1.34, the API ecosystem was overhauled and we now "
"support JWT tokens with a concept of refresh tokens and access tokens. "
"This allows for authentication without the need for sending passwords "
"with each authentication request. For a more detailed understanding of "
"how this works, please refer to :doc:`/api`. Over time, more control will"
" be added to this screen."

"The \"Revoke All Tokens\" button can be used to globally invalidate "
"access tokens for all users. If tokens are revoked, the user(s) will need"
" to re-authenticate with login and password. As of today, refresh tokens "
"last for 24 hours and access tokens for 1 hour."

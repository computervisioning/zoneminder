"WEB_TITLE - The actual text that is shown on the login screen. It is "

msgid ""
"WEB_TITLE_PREFIX - If you have more than one installation of ZoneMinder "
"it can be helpful to display different titles for each one. Changing this"
" option allows you to customise the window titles to include further "
"information to aid identification."

"HOME_URL - the link to navigate to, when a user clicks on the top left "

"HOME_CONTENT - The actual text that is shown on the top left corner. You "

msgid ""
"WEB_CONSOLE_BANNER - Allows the administrator to place an arbitrary text "
"message near the top of the web console. This is useful for the "
"developers to display a message which indicates the running instance of "
"ZoneMinder is a development snapshot, but it can also be used for any "
"other purpose as well."

"WEB_EVENT_DISK_SPACE - Adds another column to the listing of events "
"showing the disk space used by the event. This will impart a small "
"overhead as it will call du on the event directory. In practice this "
"overhead is fairly small but may be noticeable on IO-constrained systems."

msgid ""
"WEB_RESIZE_CONSOLE - Traditionally the main ZoneMinder web console window"
" has resized itself to shrink to a size small enough to list only the "
"monitors that are actually present. This is intended to make the window "
"more unobtrusize but may not be to everyones tastes, especially if opened"
" in a tab in browsers which support this kind if layout. Switch this "
"option off to have the console window size left to the users preference."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/options/options_web.rst:22
msgid ""
"WEB_ID_ON_CONSOLE - Some find it useful to have the monitor id always "
"visible on the console. This option will add a column listing it. Note "
"that if it is disabled, you can always hover over the monitor to see the "
"id as well."

"WEB_POPUP_ON_ALARM - When viewing a live monitor stream you can specify "
"whether you want the window to pop to the front if an alarm occurs when "
"the window is minimised or behind another window. This is most useful if "
"your monitors are over doors for example when they can pop up if someone "
"comes to the doorway."

msgid ""
"WEB_ALARM_SOUND - You can specify a sound file to play if an alarm occurs"
" whilst you are watching a live monitor stream. So long as your browser "
"understands the format it does not need to be any particular type. This "
"file should be placed in the sounds directory defined earlier."

"WEB_COMPACT_MONTAGE - The montage view shows the output of all of your "
"active monitors in one window. This include a small menu and status "
"information for each one. This can increase the web traffic and make the "
"window larger than may be desired. Setting this option on removes all "
"this extraneous information and just displays the images."

"WEB_EVENT_SORT_FIELD - Events in lists can be initially ordered in any "
"way you want. This option controls what field is used to sort them. You "
"can modify this ordering from filters or by clicking on headings in the "
"lists themselves. Bear in mind however that the 'Prev' and 'Next' links, "
"when scrolling through events, relate to the ordering in the lists and so"
" not always to time based ordering."

"WEB_EVENTS_PER_PAGE - In the event list view you can either list all "
"events or just a page at a time. This option controls how many events are"
" listed per page in paged mode and how often to repeat the column headers"
" in non-paged mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/options/options_web.rst:38
msgid ""
"WEB_LIST_THUMBS - Ordinarily the event lists just display text details of"
" the events to save space and time. By switching this option on you can "
"also display small thumbnails to help you identify events of interest. "
"The size of these thumbnails is controlled by the following two options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/options/options_web.rst:40
msgid ""
"WEB_LIST_THUMB_WIDTH - This options controls the width of the thumbnail "
"images that appear in the event lists. It should be fairly small to fit "
"in with the rest of the table. If you prefer you can specify a height "
"instead in the next option but you should only use one of the width or "
"height and the other option should be set to zero. If both width and "
"height are specified then width will be used and height ignored."

"WEB_USE_OBJECT_TAGS - There are two methods of including media content in"
" web pages. The most common way is use the EMBED tag which is able to "
"give some indication of the type of content. However this is not a "
"standard part of HTML. The official method is to use OBJECT tags which "
"are able to give more information allowing the correct media viewers etc "
"to be loaded. However these are less widely supported and content may be "
"specifically tailored to a particular platform or player. This option "
"controls whether media content is enclosed in EMBED tags only or whether,"
" where appropriate, it is additionally wrapped in OBJECT tags. Currently "
"OBJECT tags are only used in a limited number of circumstances but they "
"may become more widespread in the future. It is suggested that you leave "
"this option on unless you encounter problems playing some content."

"WEB_XFRAME_WARN - When creating a Web Site monitor, if the target web "
"site has X-Frame-Options set to sameorigin in the header, the site will "
"not display in ZoneMinder. This is a design feature in most modern "
"browsers. When this condition occurs, ZoneMinder will write a warning to "
"the log file. To get around this, one can install a browser plugin or "
"extension to ignore X-Frame headers, and then the page will display "
"properly. Once the plugin or extension has ben installed, the end user "
"may choose to turn this warning off"

"WEB_FILTER_SOURCE - This option only affects monitors with a source type "
"of Ffmpeg, Libvlc, or WebSite. This setting controls what information is "
"displayed in the Source column on the console. Selecting 'None' will not "
"filter anything. The entire source string will be displayed, which may "
"contain sensitive information. Selecting 'NoCredentials' will strip out "
"usernames and passwords from the string. If there are any port numbers in"
" the string and they are common (80, 554, etc) then those will be removed"
" as well. Selecting 'Hostname' will filter out all information except for"
" the hostname or ip address. When in doubt, stay with the default "
"'Hostname'. This feature uses the php function 'url_parts' to identify "
"the various pieces of the url. If the url in question is unusual or not "
"standard in some way, then filtering may not produce the desired results."

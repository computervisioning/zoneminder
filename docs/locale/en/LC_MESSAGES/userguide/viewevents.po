"If you have streaming capability you will see a series of images that "
"make up the event. Under that you should also see a progress bar. "
"Depending on your configuration this will either be static or will be "
"filled in to indicate how far through the event you are. By default this "
"functionality is turned off for low bandwidth settings as the image "
"delivery tends to not be able to keep up with real-time and the progress "
"bar cannot take this into account. Regardless of whether the progress bar"
" updates, you can click on it to navigate to particular points in the "
"events."

"You will also see a link to allow you to view the still images "
"themselves. If you don't have streaming then you will be taken directly "
"to this page. The images themselves are thumbnail size and depending on "
"the configuration and bandwidth you have chosen will either be the full "
"images scaled in your browser of actual scaled images. If it is the "
"latter, if you have low bandwidth for example, it may take a few seconds "
"to generate the images. If thumbnail images are required to be generated,"
" they will be kept and not re-generated in future. Once the images appear"
" you can mouse over them to get the image sequence number and the image "
"score."

"Commercial \"security systems\" are often designed as a monitoring system"
" with little attention to recording quality. In such a system, locating "
"and exporting relevant video can be challenging and often requires "
"extensive human intervention. ZoneMinder was designed to provide the best"
" possible record quality while allowing easy searching, filtering and "
"exporting of security footage."

"ZoneMinder is designed around a series of independent components that "
"only function when necessary, limiting any wasted resource and maximising"
" the efficiency of your machine. An outdated Pentium II PC can have "
"multiple recording devices connected to it, and it is able to track one "
"camera per device at up to 25 frames per second, which drops by "
"approximately half for each additional camera on the same device. "
"Additional cameras on devices that do not interact with other devices can"
" maintain the 25 frame rate per second. Monitoring several cameras will "
"not overload the CPU as frame processing is designed to synchronise with "
"capture."

"A fast video interface core, a user-friendly and comprehensive PHP based "
"web interface allows ZoneMinder to be efficient, friendly and most "
"importantly useful. You can control and monitor your cameras from home, "
"at work, on the road, or a web-enabled cell phone. It supports variable "
"web capabilities based on available bandwidth. The web interface also "
"allows you to view events that your cameras have captured, which can be "
"archived, reviewed or deleted. The web application directly interacts "
"with the core daemons ensuring full co-operation at all times. ZoneMinder"
" can also be installed as a system service to reboot a system remotely."

"The core of ZoneMinder is the capture and analysis of images and a highly"
" configurable set of parameters that eliminate false positives whilst "
"ensuring minimum loss of footage. For example, you can define a set of "
"'zones' for each camera of varying sensitivity and functionality. This "
"eliminates zones that you don't wish to track or define areas that will "
"alarm if various thresholds are exceeded in conjunction with other zones."

"Zones are used for image analysis in ZoneMinder and Zone definition has a"

"server. An optimally configured Zone will reduce CPU processing "
"requirements as well the number of unintended saved events. Therefore, it"

msgid ""
"The Zone Type determines the image processing method and is one of the "
"more important concepts in ZoneMinder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/definezone.rst:46
msgid ""
"**Active:** This is the default Zone type and triggers an alarm when "
"motion is detected within it. Most Zones will use this type. Only Active "
"and Exclusive Zones can initiate the triggering of an alarm."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/definezone.rst:47
msgid ""
"**Inclusive:** This Zone type can be used for any Zones that you want to "
"trigger an alarm only if at least one Active Zone has already triggered "
"one. For example this could cover an area of the image like a plant or "
"tree which moves a lot and would trigger many alarms. Perhaps this is "
"behind an area to be monitored though, in this case create an Active Zone"
" covering the non-moving parts and an Inclusive Zone covering the tree "
"perhaps with less sensitive detection settings. If something triggers an "
"alarm in the Active Zone and also in the Inclusive Zone they would both "
"be registered. The resulting alarm would be larger than if it had been "
"blanked out altogether."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/definezone.rst:48
msgid ""
"**Exclusive:** Triggers an alarm when motion is detected within it, as "
"long as no alarms have already been triggered in an Active zone. This is "
"the most specialized of the Zone types. For instance for the camera "
"covering my garden I keep watch for a hedgehog that visits most nights "
"and scoffs the food out of my cat's bowls. By creating a sensitive "
"Exclusive Zone in that area I can ensure that a hedgehog alarm will only "
"trigger if there is activity in that small area. If something much bigger"
" occurs, like someone walking by, it will trigger a regular alarm and not"
" one from the Exclusive Zone. Thus, it can be ensured that alarms for big"
" events are captured as well as special small events. Any others are "
"ignored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/definezone.rst:49
msgid ""
"**Preclusive:** If triggered this Zone type will preclude an alarm being "
"generated for that image frame. So motion or other changes that occur in "
"a Preclusive Zone will have the effect of ensuring that no alarm occurs "
"at all. The application for this Zone type is primarily as a shortcut for"
" detecting general large-scale lighting or other changes. Preclusive "
"Zones are designed to be fairly small, even just a few pixels across, "
"with quite low alarm thresholds. They should be situated in areas of the "
"image that are less likely to have motion occur such as high on a wall or"
" in a corner. Should a general illumination change occur they would be "
"triggered at least as early as any Active Zones and prevent any other "
"Zones from generating an alarm. Obviously, careful placement is required "
"to ensure that they do not cancel any genuine alarms or that they are not"
" so close together that any motion just hops from one Preclusive Zone to "
"another. Preclusive Zones may also be used to reduce processing time by "
"situating one over an Active zone. The Preclusive Zone is processed "
"first; if it is triggered the rest of the Zones will not be processed. "
"See Extend Alarm Frame Count below for a way to hold the Preclusive Zone "
"active for an extended period."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/definezone.rst:50
msgid ""
"**Inactive:** Suppresses the detection of motion within it. This can be "
"layered on top of any other Zone type, preventing motion within the "
"Inactive Zone from being effective for any other Zone type. Use Inactive "
"Zones to cover areas in which nothing notable will ever happen or where "
"false alarms would occur that don't relate to what is being monitored. "
"Inactive Zones may be placed over other Zones to reduce detection areas. "
"As a general practice Zones should abut each other instead of overlapping"
" to avoid processing of the same area more than once."
msgstr ""

#: ../../userguide/definezone.rst:51
msgid ""
"**Privacy:** Blackens the pixels within it to make the region completely "
"opaque. This can be used to hide regions within the image if the "
"situation does not allow another solution. This Zone type is different "
"from all the others in that it gets processed as soon as possible during "
"capture (even before the timestamp is added to the image) and is not part"
" of the analyzing process. Note that if a Privacy Zone is added, changed "
"or deleted, the changes will not be seen in the image until the capture "
"process is restarted. This is done automatically, but generally takes a "
"few seconds."

"parameters can be subsequently changed as desired. For a ZoneMinder "
"server running on modern equipment with few monitors, the 'Best, high "

msgid ""
"It is important to understand that the available Presets are intended "
"merely as a starting point. Because every camera view is unique, they are"
" not guaranteed to work properly in every case. Presets tend to work "
"acceptably for indoor cameras where the objects of interest are "
"relatively close and typically there are few or no unwanted objects "
"moving within the camera view. Presets, on the other hand, tend to not "
"work acceptably for outdoor cameras where the field of view is typically "
"much wider, objects of interest are farther away and changing weather "
"patterns can cause false triggers. For outdoor cameras the motion "
"detection will need to be tuned for each Zone to obtain desired results."

"For performance reasons, as soon as the criteria for one of the analysis "

"**FilteredPixels:** Selecting the FilteredPixels Alarm Check Method adds "

"The various options you can specify are displayed in a tabbed dialog with"
" each group of options displayed under a different heading. Each option "
"is displayed with its name, a short description and the current value. "
"You can also click on the ‘?’ link following each description to get a "
"fuller explanation about each option. This is the same as you would get "
"from zmconfig.pl. A number of option groups have a master option near the"
" top which enables or disables the whole group so you should be aware of "
"the state of this before modifying options and expecting them to make any"
" difference."

"If you have changed the value of an option you should then ‘save’ it. A "
"number of the option groups will then prompt you to let you know that the"
" option(s) you have changed will require a system restart. This is not "
"done automatically in case you will be changing many values in the same "
"session, however once you have made all of your changes you should "
"restart ZoneMinder as soon as possible. The reason for this is that web "
"and some scripts will pick up the new changes immediately but some of the"
" daemons will still be using the old values and this can lead to data "
"inconsistency or loss."
